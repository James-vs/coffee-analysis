# coffee-analysis
Shuyan update 13th Aug
## Description

We are a coffee company based in Southampton, UK, and are looking to improve where we source our coffee from. The quality of coffee sourced from our existing suppliers has significantly reduced in recent years, so we want to change suppliers whilst maintaining our reputation as the best artisanal coffee place in town.

We have obtained a wealth of coffee supplier data from the independent Coffee Quality Institute, but we lack the skills required to analyse the data to help us decide where to send our coffee buyers to negotiate a new supply.

## Pre-requisites

Python3 installed and some kind of OS would be ideal.

## Installation

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Today is Saturday. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Usage
Used by the coffee owner to assess which coffee is best 
depending on their specific criteria. They want to be able to 
edit the filters.
